# HR-Analytics Dashboard-Data Analysis and Visualization
This project uses the Human Resources dataset, and data cleaning and preprocessing is performed on it using SQL queries.
Further, data analysis is done based on the attributes such as hire date, termination date, department etc. using SQL Workbench.
The analysed data is represented in the form of charts and graphs using Power BI.
